# Repository Illustrating GitHub Actions


##  Building and publishing packages.
GitHub Actions allows you to automate your software development workflows, such as building and publishing packages. Here's an overview of how to use GitHub Actions to build and publish packages:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub for your package.

2. Create a new workflow file in the repository's .github/workflows directory. This file will contain the steps for building and publishing your package.

3. In the workflow file, define a job that runs when a new commit is pushed to the repository. This job will be responsible for building and packaging your code.

4. Define the steps for the job, such as checking out the code, running tests, and creating a package.

5. Use the GitHub Actions built-in actions or 3rd party actions to publish the package to a package manager like npm, PyPI or maven

6. Commit and push the workflow file to your repository, and GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow and publish your package.

7. You can also set up GitHub Actions to automatically publish new versions of your package when new commits are pushed to specific branches or tags, or when pull requests are merged.

Please note that the above is a general overview of the process, and the specific steps will depend on the package manager, language and framework you are using, and the actions you are using.
