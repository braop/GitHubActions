# Repository Illustrating GitHub Actions


##  Building and publishing packages.
GitHub Actions allows you to automate your software development workflows, such as building and publishing packages. Here's an overview of how to use GitHub Actions to build and publish packages:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub for your package.

2. Create a new workflow file in the repository's .github/workflows directory. This file will contain the steps for building and publishing your package.

3. In the workflow file, define a job that runs when a new commit is pushed to the repository. This job will be responsible for building and packaging your code.

4. Define the steps for the job, such as checking out the code, running tests, and creating a package.

5. Use the GitHub Actions built-in actions or 3rd party actions to publish the package to a package manager like npm, PyPI or maven

6. Commit and push the workflow file to your repository, and GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow and publish your package.

7. You can also set up GitHub Actions to automatically publish new versions of your package when new commits are pushed to specific branches or tags, or when pull requests are merged.

Please note that the above is a general overview of the process, and the specific steps will depend on the package manager, language and framework you are using, and the actions you are using.


## Firebase App Distribution to deploy app to play store
Firebase App Distribution is a service that allows developers to easily distribute their apps to testers and then to the Google Play store. Here's an overview of how to use Firebase App Distribution to deploy an app to the Google Play store:

1. Set up a Firebase project: First, you need to create a Firebase project in the Firebase console and connect it to your app. This will allow you to use Firebase services such as Analytics and Crashlytics in your app.

2. Integrate Firebase App Distribution in your app: You need to add the Firebase App Distribution SDK to your app and configure it. This will allow you to distribute your app to testers.

3. Add testers: You can invite testers to your app by sending them an email invite or by sharing a link. Testers will then be able to download your app and provide feedback.

4. Distribute your app to testers: Once you have integrated the Firebase App Distribution SDK and added testers, you can distribute your app to them by clicking on the Distribute button in the Firebase console.

5. Collect feedback: Testers can provide feedback on your app by leaving comments and reporting bugs. You can view this feedback in the Firebase console.

6. Release your app to the Google Play Store: Once you have collected feedback and made any necessary changes to your app, you can release it to the Google Play Store by following the standard process in the Google Play Console.

7. Monitor your app: After you have released your app to the Google Play Store, you can use Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics to monitor its performance and get insights on user behavior and crashes.

Please note that this is a general overview of the process, and the specific steps will depend on the framework and language you are using, as well as the version of Firebase App Distribution.
